# Domain Driven Design

Domain Driven Design (also known as DDD) was coined by Eric Evans. In his book [Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215), Evans provides a solid framework and set of techniques for domain modeling.Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the needs of its users.
